What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was having some trouble merging in git before the GPS session.
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Merging, and pushing branches were concepts I understand more cleary after the GPS session.
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked my pair about the git fectch command and we asked out guide about some markdown syntax.
What still confuses you about Git?
In Git, I am still a little confused on pushing files correctly the first time around. I usually have to try a time or two.
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I think it was a really goo first GPS experience. Our guide was friendly and helpful at times when we needed an extra reminder to go back, but he did not talk much at all to help us concentrate on pairing with each other. Tim was a great pairing partner and very helpful in figuring out the lesson.
